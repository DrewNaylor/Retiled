Note: This is Inter version 4.0 beta 8 as of April 13, 2023. I, Drew Naylor, am
distributing this version because the stable version is almost two years old at
this point. This file (note-from-drew-naylor.txt) was not part of the
Inter package and as such does not fall under the same license as Inter
(SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1), but instead falls under the CC0 license
because it's just a note (see details of the CC0 here:
