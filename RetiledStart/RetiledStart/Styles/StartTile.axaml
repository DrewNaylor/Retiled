		<Setter Property="Background" Value="#0050ef" />
		<!-- Set text color. I tested a few different accent colors,
		and I don't think any of them used black, even the really light ones.
		Something to keep in mind is that the high contrast theme put a black
		box behind the text, so I'll have to figure that out. -->

		<Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="0" />
		<!-- Put stuff at the bottom. I have to change this to
		make it so that icons and other information show up properly
		and don't get aligned to the bottom. Maybe there should be
		a style just for the textblock which has its VerticalContentAlignment
		set to the bottom.
		
		Some Live Tiles like Photos has the text above the slideshow,
		so I need to figure out a way to have the text there and other
		stuff at the same time. I'll have to add a style for tiles that
		the user doesn't want to have their names show up as well as when
		tiles are small, but I'm not sure how images will be displayed.
		
		Actually, I think I know how images and stuff could be shown, and
		there would just be a TextBlock for the app name, a PictureBox for the icon,
		and whatever way LiveTiles would be displayed, all contained within a panel
		or something.-->
		<Setter Property="VerticalContentAlignment" Value="Bottom" />
		<!-- I think these padding values are really close to WP's values.
		They were compared to a screenshot using a tile that had the same
		name. -->
		<Setter Property="Padding" Value="8,0,0,6" />
		<!-- Set the margin. -->
		<Setter Property="Margin" Value="5" />
