It just makes no sense compared to Python and especially Visual Studio. Like, the important project properties aren't stored in per-user files in VS, so that you can just clone and build a project anywhere, but CMake ends up complaining that it can't find the right tools even if you tell it to use Qt 6.3. And I can't figure out how to tell Qt Creator that it should build in a different folder without CMake complaining that the source and build folders don't match. Maybe it's a per-user file issue, but it shouldn't be.
