I've archived them under the "archive" folder. The files will be available under
"archive/RetiledStart" and "archive/libRetiledStart" for now. They
will be deleted after determining that I don't need the code in the repo anymore,
though I'll go through the main Avalonia-based RetiledStart files to see if I need
anything anywhere else. libRetiledStart will probably remain in the archive as the
YAML file-related code will be useful for guinget when I work on the sources manager
app, so I'll keep that code in the archive.

Update: the folders have been deleted, but you can access the tags from here:
https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/releases/tag/before-archiving-avalonia-based-retiledsearch
and here:
https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/releases/tag/before-archiving-avalonia-based-retiledstart
These links are mainly for myself so I know where to look for the code at, since some of it will still be of use to me, mainly the yaml-related stuff.
