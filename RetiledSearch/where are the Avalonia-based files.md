I've archived them under the "archive" folder. The files will be available under
"archive/RetiledSearch" and "archive/libRetiledSearch" for now. They
will be deleted after the Avalonia-based RetiledStart files are archived and replaced with QML-based
ones. Before those are archived, another tag will be made for them. It's expected that the
Avalonia-based projects will be deleted shortly after the first release of Retiled is published.

Update: the folders have been deleted, but you can access the tags from here:<br>
https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/releases/tag/before-archiving-avalonia-based-retiledsearch
<br>and here:<br>
https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/releases/tag/before-archiving-avalonia-based-retiledstart
<br>These links are mainly for myself so I know where to look for the code at, since some of it will still be of use to me, mainly the yaml-related stuff.
