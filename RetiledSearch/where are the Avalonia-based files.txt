I've archived them under the "archive" folder. The files will be available under
"archive/RetiledSearch" and "archive/libRetiledSearch" for now. They
will be deleted after the Avalonia-based RetiledStart files are archived and replaced with QML-based
ones. Before those are archived, another tag will be made for them. It's expected that the
Avalonia-based projects will be deleted shortly after the first release of Retiled is published.
