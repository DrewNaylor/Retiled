# Retiled Version 0.1 Developer Preview 2 Changelog
Released on 4/22/2023 (MM/DD/YYYY).
(Release date is tentative and may change).

Two years and four months since the first release, I'm now ready to publish the second release. This version includes some major bug fixes that only showed up after the previous version was published (due to probably implementing things incorrectly and the behavior being fixed in Qt, but that lead to a regression in my code) and other annoyances that were in DP1. Here are some highlights:
- Now you can leave edit mode by tapping on the blank area outside tiles
- The wp-metro icon font I'm using for the arrow icon and the search button should now display properly
- I've also integrated icon support
  - It's a little choppy when scrolling the All Apps list though, likely due to not caching the `Icon` value from .desktop files when loading the All Apps list items
  - Also for some reason the icons are now blurry on first loading if using HiDPI and I only noticed this after updating to Qt6.5 on my PinePhone, but resizing tiles manually and scrolling the All Apps list far enough around to refresh the images seems to fix it temporarily
  - I'm using pyxdg for this capability, so it'll have to be installed if you don't already have it; package names for it in some distros are in `README.md` and also in the Readme included with the Zip file package for this version of Retiled.
- Added initial support for both tile backgrounds (like WP8.1, in the tiles) and standard backgrounds (behind tiles, like W10M added and most phone launchers have)
  - These currently have issues if using parallax scrolling, where the image starts disappearing if you have too many tiles, but you can turn off parallax via an accessibility option as described below
- Several theme-related customization options set via a config file (`./RetiledSettings/configs/themes.config`, but it can be copied to `~/.config/Retiled/RetiledSettings/configs/themes.config` to make editing easier)
  - Accent color
  - Icon theme if you don't want Breeze Dark
  - An option for which image to use as a wallpaper based on file path
  - Even options to alter the wallpaper overlay layer color so it can be stuff besides a 20% opacity black rectangle
- Two accessibility options in its own config file  (`./RetiledSettings/configs/accessibility.config`)
 - Whether to allow control tilting when pressed (by the way, I figured out how to do tilting for buttons and stuff, even though it doesn't yet follow the cursor except in one of the nine predefined directions [eight plus the middle])
 - Whether to use parallax wallpaper scrolling
- I've also switched to using the [Inter Display](https://github.com/rsms/inter) font if it's installed (tested with v4.0 beta 8)
- This version **deprecates setting raw tile width and height values** in favor of integrating [TilesGrid](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/TilesGrid) (my fork) in v0.1-DP3
  - We'll still load raw tile widths and heights for now, and you'll get a message on startup telling you about this with a way to convert your config file to the new format by manually forcing a save through entering edit mode then leaving it [this situation is handled specifically, but we won't allow force-saving if the config file has been converted to using `TileSize` with values of `small`, `medium`, and `wide`, with all other values defaulting to `medium`]).
- The All Apps list has a scrollbar
  - It's imperfect, looks like it's way too far into the edge of the window, and stays visible for longer than I'd like, but at least it exists.
- pyyaml has been **removed from my distribution (of Retiled)**, so you'll have to install it yourself if it's not already installed. Names for its package in some distros are in `README.md` and also in the Readme included with the Zip file package for this version of Retiled.

There are several more changes than this, and I hope it's not too underwhelming for how long the wait was.

Please be sure to read the Readme included in the package or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/blob/main/docs/readmes/readme-v0.1-DP2.txt) as it has important info, as well as the [System Requirements](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/blob/main/docs/system-requirements.md).

Please note that this version doesn't yet support running as its own environment, so you'll have to run it in something else. Plasma Mobile is recommended, as both Retiled and Plasma use Qt. In fact, [I'm planning on turning Retiled into mainly a Look-and-Feel package for Plasma Mobile](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/issues/182) so that it can take advantage of the features provided in Plasma Mobile but I'll be tweaking various UI elements to make it what I need.

If you are reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar if using Notepad on Windows. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub, and should already be used in VS Code, Kate, and KWrite.

The full changelog is available after the Hashes section. To make things easier, some items were at least partially copied from the highlights above.

- There's now an early Action Center app and an early Wayland compositor, but they're not close to being integrated and I'm thinking about just eventally making a custom Look-and-Feel package for Plasma Mobile (https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/issues/182). Some of the work from these two components will be reused for the Plasma Mobile-integrated version.

# Fixed
(note: some of these items listed here might not be directly relating to a filed issue so they will be phrased differently)

- Now you can leave edit mode by tapping on the blank area outside tiles
  - Before you had to tap directly on the currently-active tile.
