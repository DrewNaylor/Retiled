# Retiled Version 0.1 Developer Preview 2 Changelog
Released on 4/22/2023 (MM/DD/YYYY).
(Release date is tentative and may change).

Two years and four months since the first release, I'm now ready to publish the second release. This version includes some major bug fixes that only showed up after the previous version was published (due to probably implementing things incorrectly and the behavior being fixed in Qt, but that lead to a regression in my code) and other annoyances that were in DP1. Here are some highlights:
- Now you can leave edit mode by tapping on the blank area outside tiles
- I've also integrated icon support
  - It's a little choppy when scrolling the All Apps list though, likely due to not caching the `Icon` value from .desktop files when loading the All Apps list items
  - Also for some reason the icons are now blurry on first loading if using HiDPI and I only noticed this after updating to Qt6.5 on my PinePhone, but resizing tiles manually and scrolling the All Apps list far enough around to refresh the images seems to fix it temporarily
- Added initial support for both tile backgrounds (like WP8.1, in the tiles) and standard backgrounds (behind tiles, like W10M and most phone launchers) 
  - These currently have issues if using parallax scrolling, where the image starts disappearing if you have too many tiles, but you can turn off parallax via an accessibility option as described below
- Several theme-related customization options set via a config file (`./RetiledSettings/configs/themes.config`)
  - Accent color
  - Icon theme if you don't want Breeze Dark
  - An option for which image to use as a wallpaper based on file path
  - Even options to alter the wallpaper overlay layer color so it can be stuff besides a 20% opacity black rectangle
- Two accessibility options in its own config file  (`./RetiledSettings/configs/accessibility.config`)
 - Whether to allow control tilting when pressed
 - Whether to use parallax wallpaper scrolling
- I've also switched to using the [Inter Display]() font if it's installed (tested with v4.0 beta 8)
- This version **deprecates setting raw tile width and height values** in favor of integrating [TilesGrid]() in v0.1-DP3
  - We'll still load raw tile widths and heights for now, and you'll get a message on startup telling you about this with a way to convert your config file to the new format by manually forcing a save through entering edit mode then leaving it [this situation is handled specifically, but we won't allow force-saving if the config file has been converted to using `TileSize` with values of `small`, `medium`, and `wide`, with all other values defaulting to `medium`]).
- The All Apps list has a scrollbar
  - It's imperfect, looks like it's way too far into the edge of the window, and stays visible for longer than I'd like, but at least it exists.
There are several more changes than this, and I hope it's not too underwhelming for how long the wait was.
