# Retiled Version 0.1 Developer Preview 1 Changelog
Released on 12/12/2021 (MM/DD/YYYY).

After eight months of work and an entire rewrite, Retiled is ready for its first pre-release at version 0.1 Developer Preview 1! Couldn't have done it without Microsoft's documentation on how Windows Phone looks and behaves, PySide6 and Qt, PyYAML, the [wp-metro font](https://github.com/ajtroxell/wp-metro), and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans). This project wouldn't even exist without [Windows Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone) existing first, as the UI is meant to resemble Windows Phone. Please be sure to read the Readme included with Retiled or [online](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/blob/main/docs/readmes/readme-v0.1-DP1.txt) as it has important info. Also refer to the [System Requirements](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/Retiled/blob/main/docs/system-requirements.md).

If you are reading this in Notepad or another text editor, it displays best in Word Wrap view. Click on Format>Word Wrap on the top bar. Notepad++ users will find it under View>Word Wrap. Word Wrap is automatically done if viewing on GitHub or on the website.

## Hashes

MD5 checksums/hashes are not used for Retiled as they are weaker than SHA-256. [More details](https://github.com/DrewNaylor/UXL-Launcher/issues/124), though they're not as relevant to Retiled:


You can use sha256sum to confirm the hash of the files by running
"find . -type f -exec sha256sum {} \;" in the folder you extracted the archive to and comparing the output to my sums listed below. Be sure that you don't copy the quotes. Hopefully this'll work on non-Bash systems, like postmarketOS. I got this command from this Ask Ubuntu answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/486094 . HowToGeek has a nice article on checksums and stuff:

## Features

Instead of a standard changelog, I'm going to list some features of Retiled.

- RetiledStart
  - You can pin apps to RetiledStart's Start screen by swiping from the right side of the screen toward the left or by tapping the right-facing arrow (All Apps button) at the bottom of the tiles to go to the All Apps list, then long-press on an app and tap "pin to start".
  - Any tiles can be resized from medium, to small, to wide, by long-pressing on a tile to enter "global edit mode", which displays edit buttons on tiles, then tap the resize button in the bottom-right of the tile. Save your changes by single-tapping any tile with edit buttons, but be sure not to tap the edit buttons themselves.
  - Unpinning tiles is done by tapping the unpin button in the top-right of any tile with edit buttons.
  - If you don't want to use tiles, you can unpin all of them, and you'll stay in the All Apps list until more are pinned. Unpinning the last tile will save the layout automatically.
- RetiledSearch
  - Typing anything into the search box then pressing "Enter" on your keyboard or tapping the "search" button below the search box will open your default browser to the Bing search results for what you typed.
