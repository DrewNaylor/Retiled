# Extra app ideas

Besides the core apps in Retiled such as RetiledStart and RetiledSearch, I think some extra apps would be cool. These apps won't be included in the core package nor will they be dependencies, though it may be a good idea to make all the styles used in Retiled their own package that can be pulled in as a dependency from the package manager. As a result, when publishing this on GitHub, I should probably just not include the styles with any zip file other than the "coreplusstyles" package, which includes the core apps plus the styles, as the name says. There then needs to be a "core" package and a "styles" package so it's easier to submit to package repos like the AUR. Maybe a "full" package would be useful too, containing the "core" package, the "styles" package, and every other extra package I end up developing as listed below. I'll probably have to include the styles with each individual package, and that may be difficult if I don't write a program to help me copy all the packages into the right folders before publishing each version.
