Note: this is just the main part of the description in for the video in the filename.

Some apps can now be launched from the All Apps list, and this video shows what it looks like in portrait mode. There are also some apps that can't yet run from the All Apps list, and I need to remove stuff like "%u" from their "Exec" key to make them work.

It takes a while to start apps on the PinePhone, which might be partly why Plasma Mobile has a splash screen when you open stuff. I'll have to add one to RetiledStart if I figure out how to do it or someone else helps with it.

Something else I should mention besides currently needing the scrollbar to scroll the list is that none of the apps display their "Name" key yet, so you either have to guess what an app is, or rotate the phone into landscape mode. I'll be showing this in a future video.
