Note: I only copied over the relevant part and left the boilerplate at the bottom there. The following is what's supposed to be in the description for the YouTube "Shorts" video in the filename.

Tonight I decided to just start working on my Action Center implementation. The first Action Command is a toggle for the flashlight (something Windows Phone 8.1 never had as far as I know, and I always had to rely on a Hardware Tests secondary tile for the flashlight instead), and is thus easy to demo. 

You can toggle the flashlight as quickly as you want as long as the phone can handle it, but I didn't do that on camera because it's a seizure hazard. There is no other UI available to show yet, so I hope this is enough for now.

For now there's no icon and the text is in the wrong spot, but those can be fixed easily.

I got the flashlight-toggling commands from this page on megi's website: https://xnux.eu/devices/feature/flash-pp.html

As always, the code is available in the repository:
