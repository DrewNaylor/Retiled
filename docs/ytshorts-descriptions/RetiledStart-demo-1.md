Note: this is just the main part of the description for the video in the filename.

This is a demo of the prototype for RetiledStart running on the PinePhone. The tiles are supposed to be the same color as Windows Phone 8.x's "Cobalt", but I'm not sure if it's correct as Cobalt varied depending on the firmware and Avalonia might not be displaying it exactly like my Lumia 822 (and Lumia 830 on Lumia Denim, though not before that firmware version) did.

Scrolling isn't available when dragging on the buttons like Windows Phone allowed, so I have to scroll in the sidebar. Hopefully I can figure that out or Avalonia adds an easy way to do that so it's as mechanically similar to WP as possible.

There's also supposed to be three columns of large tiles visible, but that doesn't seem to be happening here, and that might just be due to how much room is available. Not sure if that's my fault, Avalonia, or Xwayland.

Sorry about the background noise, I was working on backups.
