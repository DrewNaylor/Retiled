The ellipsis/"More", pin, and unpin SVG files originate from OpenClipart, so I don't think I should place a license or copyright on them restricting their usage. I think that just lets you do whatever you want with them, as long as it doesn't put anyone in harm's way, is legal, and abides by the licenses for the projects you're using them in.
